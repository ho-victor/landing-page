        "Life is a bowl of cherries. Some cherries are rotten while 
        others are good; its your job to throw out the rotten ones 
        and forget about them while you enjoy eating the ones that are 
        good! There are two kinds of people: those who choose to throw
         out the good cherries and wallow in all the rotten ones, and those 
         who choose to throw out all the rotten ones and savor all the good 
         ones."
